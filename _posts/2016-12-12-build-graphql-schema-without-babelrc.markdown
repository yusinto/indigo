Man it has been a busy month! It's been a while since I blogged, I have to say I miss it a lot. Almost as much as I 
miss drinking.. 

Today I'll be talking about graphql and relay, specifically about building the schema. Warning this is not a beginner's
guide to graphql and relay, there are tons of other tutorials which can help you with that. This blog is about
decoupling your graphql schema build from your project's .babelrc file.

## The problem
Your project has a .babelrc file which contains presets, plugins, etc used by babel when you run your app. You need 
to include babelRelayPlugin in your .babelrc plugins section so your app can understand 
graphql schema. 

However, babelRelayPlugin.js contains a reference to schema.json which is generated by running 
babel-node updateSchema.js which in turn uses .babelrc which has a dependency on babelRelayPlugin which...is a cyclic 
dependency which gives me a migraine.

## The solution
Do not use babel-node to build your schema. Just use plain vanilla node in combination with babel-register with inline
config when building your schema.



In my [previous previous post](http://www.reactjunkie.com/react-feature-toggle-launch-darkly/){:target="_blank"} 
I introduced launch darkly as a feature toggling platform and how to use it with react redux. In this post I
will explain how you can further leverage the power of feature toggling with user targeting.
 
## What's user targeting?
You have a feature or functionality you only want to display to a select group of audience. For example 
releasing a beta feature to users who have signed up. Kinda like a sneak preview for early adopters. 
Or perhaps you want to show special offers only to premium members of your website. This is user targeting.

## Ok sounds interesting. How do I do it?
On init, you'll need to pass a user object to Launch Darkly so it has something to work with: 

{% highlight javascript %}
import ldClient from 'ldclient-js';

// Launch Darkly supports the following user attributes by default
const user = {
   key: 'some-unique-key', // mandatory, the only mandatory property
   ip: '111.222.3.4',
   email: 'some@email.com',
   name: 'React Junkie',
   firstName: 'React',
   lastName: 'Junkie',
   country: 'Australia'
};

ldClient.initialize('your/client/side/id', user);
{% endhighlight %}

You'll need to pass a user object containing at least a key property to Launch Darkly.

## Configure the dashboard
Login to Launch Darkly and in the Feature Flags section select a feature flag. In the targeting section,
you can target individual users, use rules to target a group of users or default to a blanket rule for 
all users.

I will delve into using rules to target a group of users because I think that's a more common use case 
compared to targeting individual users.

For example, the settings below will target users in Australia:

![Targeting user by country?](/assets/images/user_targeting_by_country.png)

You can also serve true to a percentage of Australian users using the "percentage rollout" serve option.
For example the settings below will rollout true to 50% of Australian users:

![Targeting user by country percentage rollout?](/assets/images/user_targeting_percentage_rollout.png)

###Advanced targeting
If you look carefully there's an Advanced option if you select percentage rollout. The purpose of this 
option is not very obvious. In our example above you can use this advanced option to further group 
Australian users by (say) their browser.
 
For example, the settings below will serve true to half of chrome users, half of safari users, 
half of firefox users, etc. It's a way of "bucketing" your users so each bucket receives the 
percentage rollout you specified.

##Usage with ld-redux
If you use [ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux){:target="_blank"}, you pass the user object
as the third parameter to ldRedux.init method:
{% highlight javascript %}
import createStore from '<your-project>/store';
import ldRedux from 'ld-redux';

// standard redux createStore
const store = createStore();

const user = {
   key: 'some-unique-key',
   ip: '111.222.3.4',
   email: 'some@email.com',
   name: 'React Junkie',
   firstName: 'React',
   lastName: 'Junkie',
   country: 'Australia'
};

// Pass the user object after store to the init method
ldRedux.init('yourClientSideId', store, user);
 
render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router routes={routes} history={browserHistory}/>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('reactDiv')
);
{% endhighlight %}

By default, if you don't specify a user object, ld-redux will create a default
user like below:

{% highlight javascript %}
user = {
   key: uuid.v4(),
   ip: ip.address(),
   custom: {
        browser: userAgentParser.getResult().browser.name,
        device, // either mobile, tablet or desktop
   },
};
{% endhighlight %}

You can see the complete logic for default user creation [here](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/blob/master/src/init.js){:target="_blank"}.

The custom property allows you to pass any arbitrary properties to Launch Darkly which you can use for targeting. This is very useful and powerful.

## Conclusion
Feature flagging coupled with user targeting is a powerful way to control the target audience of your app's functionality. This opens up a whole
new world of possibilities in regards to you can do with your app. Someday all apps will be built this way.

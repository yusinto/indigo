<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Yusinto Ngadiman and I'm a coding addict. My react journey started in 2015 with react v0.11
and since then I have released 3 production react websites and 2 of them with graphql. My journey has taken me
to React Paris 2017 and 2018, the graphql conference in sf in 2017 and it's still going!
</p>
<p>
I love open source, it's my life! My wife has a different view of it. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/yusinto" target="_blank">github page</a>
and star my repos if you use/like them!
</p>
<p>
I am available for freelance work. If you are in need for react developers
please <a href="mailto:yusinto@gmail.com">email me</a> to have a friendly chat.
</p>

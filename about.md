<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Yusinto Ngadiman and I'm a coding addict, specifically react. I come from a .NET
background and I did angular for a while. However, sometime ago I started doing react and I never look back. The
react/redux/react router/relay ecosystem have really changed front end development as I know it.
</p>
<p>
It is now so easy to develop performant single page apps with server side rendering and modularisation. Most importantly,
it has brought back the fun in front end development.
